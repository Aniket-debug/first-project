    <h1> What is Competitve Programming? How & from Where to start?</h1>
    <p class="c1">
        Well there are some prerequisites for CP and DSA. that is Programming language.
        so which Programming language should i learn to start with this?
        well there are some popular languages like.
        <ul>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Python</li>

        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
        Competitve Programming is the way of learing DSA and enhansing your coding and problem
        solving skills. it will help you in your online coding assesments of companies.
        There are some popular Competive Programming websites given blow.
    </p>
    <ol type="I">
        <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://atcoder.jp/">Atcoder</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codechef.com/">Codechef</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c3">
        And There are also some DSA learning platforms.
    </p>
    <ol type="A">

        Apart from this there are some more websites which regularly host
        contests in which you can participate and earn some goodies and cash prises

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.newtonschool.co/">NewtonSchool</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codingninjas.com">CodingNinjas</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.hackearth.com">Heckearth</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Heckearrank</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c5">
        I know if you are bigginer then you must be thinking
        why i don't consider hackerrank and hackearth as competitive Programming
        community?<br>
        Well These sites don't organise the contests so frequnty.
        and one more reason is that there is no competitve exposure 
        they usually host reqruitment coding assesments.
        but any ways they are also good websites for learning DSA 
        and for participation in contests.

        there are some rare contests that happen rairly.
